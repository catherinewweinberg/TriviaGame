# TriviaGame

JavaScript, jQuery, Google Fonts, and a little bit of bootstrap was used to create this game.

Directions:
When the start button is clicked you will be provided five trivia questions about Fraggle Rock. You have 90 seconds to answer all of the questions.

<!-- When the "Finished!" button is selected the timer should stop and you are provided your score.  I still have some work to do on this part.-->
